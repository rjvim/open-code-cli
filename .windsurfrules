# open-code-cli Project Guide

## Implementation Priority
1. Core CLI structure and command registration
2. GitHub repo validation and download utilities
3. Configuration and tracking mechanisms
4. Enhanced UX with spinners and color-coded feedback
5. Comprehensive test coverage for all components

## Repository Guidelines
- This is a public repository, be respectful and ensure content makes sense to others
- Use Github CLI (`gh` command) for GitHub operations (already authenticated)
- Fix linting issues using tools specified in package.json
- Format commit messages as: `type: description` (with quotes)
  - Commit type must be one of [add, update, remove, fix, meta, release]
- The main branch is protected - use merge queue for PRs
- Update GitHub PRs and issues regularly with progress
- Read PR/issue comments for crucial information
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in code and documentation
- Check current branch before creating new branches
- Verify information before making statements
- Update documentation only after implementing described behavior
- Double-check changes before committing, pushing, and creating PRs
- For larger tasks, consider creating detailed GitHub issues for tracking


## Code Architecture
- **Modular design**: Each command in separate module with registration pattern
